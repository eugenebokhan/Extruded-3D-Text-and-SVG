# Extruded 3D Text and SVG

This project is a demonstration of how to render extruded 3d text and svg with [`Metal`](https://developer.apple.com/metal/). Inspired by [Warren Moore](https://github.com/warrenm)'s [artice](http://metalbyexample.com/text-3d/).

## Note

In this project there were used sources of [PocketSVG](https://github.com/pocketsvg/PocketSVG) library to convert SVG to CGPaths, so it doesn't support svgs with "#" color declarations.
